# Recipe:: symlinks

# Since Vagrant on an NTFS host doesn't support symlinks properly,
# We decided to move the node_modules and tmp directory off the shared disk.

# Create a folder to store the symlinked directories
symlinked_folder = ::File.join(node['appbox']['apps_dir'], node['cookbook_phpbox']['appname'], 'symlinks')
directory symlinked_folder do
  owner 'vagrant'
  group 'vagrant'
  action :create
  recursive true
end

# Loop through the symlniks. They need to be relative to the project folder, and they link to the symlink folder above.
Array(node['cookbook_phpbox']['symlinks']).each_with_index do |relative_folder, index|

  # Deduce the two locations
  source_folder = ::File.join(node['appbox']['apps_dir'], node['cookbook_phpbox']['appname'], 'current', relative_folder)
  destination_folder = ::File.join(symlinked_folder, relative_folder)

  # Ensure the source folder doesn't exist
  directory source_folder do
    recursive true
    action :delete
    not_if "test -dL #{source_folder}"
  end

  # Ensure the destination folder does exist
  directory destination_folder do
    owner 'vagrant'
    group 'vagrant'
    action :create
    recursive true
  end

  # Create the symbolic link
  link source_folder do
    owner 'vagrant'
    group 'vagrant'
    to destination_folder
    not_if "test -d #{source_folder}"
  end
